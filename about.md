I'm a [New York Code + Design Academy](https://nycda.com) graduate, that has an interest in fitness wearables and technology. I like designing applications that have clean, simple user experience that hides the complexities beneath. It's those complexities beneath the surface that I really enjoy programming in, along with an interest in hardware programming.

Before becoming a developer, I was a math teacher, ski and sailing instructor that has lived in places from Vermont and California to New Zealand. I discovered my interest in programming while incorporating basic Javascript into algebra lessons for 5th and 6th graders, along with assisting the systems administrator on various command-line tasks for deploying programs. I have now been able to fully immerse myself in web application programming thanks to NYCDA and the excellent teachers there.

I'm a [New York Code + Design Academy](https://nycda.com) student, soon to be graduate, that has an interest in fitness wearables and technology. I like designing applications that have clean, simple user experience that hides the complexities beneath. It's those complexities beneath the surface that I really enjoy programming in, along with an interest in hardware programming.

If you'd like to see some of my projects, feel free to check out my
